Advanced Turret Destruction in Godot
Overview
This project is a comprehensive guide to simulating turret destruction in a nuanced manner using Godot Engine. This is not your everyday "blow-things-up" model; this project employs regional specific sprite creation and advanced shader techniques to dissolve turret pieces. Additionally, we delve into recursion functions to subdivide the original sprite into smaller, regional specific sprites for a more realistic destruction experience.

Features
Regional Specific Sprites: Techniques to break a sprite into regional pieces, so that the destruction feels authentic.
Recursion Functionality: Use of recursion for sprite subdivision, allowing for a detailed cascade effect during destruction.
Shader Effects: Shader code to perform a dissolve effect on turret pieces, adding a cinematic quality to the destruction.
Prerequisites
Godot Engine 4.x
Basic understanding of GDScript
Familiarity with 2D sprite manipulation and shader programming
Quick Start
Clone this repository.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/imperativelyfunctional/godot-recursion
Open the project in Godot Engine.
Run the main_scene.tscn to view the demo.
Usage
Regional Specific Sprite Creation
Check out the turret.gd script for an in-depth look at how regional specific sprites are created using pixel-level manipulation.

Recursion Functionality
The recursion_handler.gd script contains the logic for subdividing the sprite into smaller sprites through recursive methods.

Shader Effects
Navigate to main/vanishing.gdshader to understand the dissolve effect applied to turret pieces.
